    <h2>World Wide Web General</h2>
    <p>The most essential technologies that made the WWW successful were: <strong>HTML, HTTP, Web Browsers, URLs, CSS, JavaScript, Servers</strong>.</p>

    <p>Resources on the web are addressed using <strong>URLs</strong>.</p>

    <p>A URL is the address used to access a resource on a web server. It contains the scheme, domain name, path, and sometimes a query or fragment.</p>

    <h2>Web Server</h2>
    <p>A web server is a software or hardware system that stores, processes, and delivers web content to users over the Internet.</p>

    <p>A web server is a computer system that hosts websites and delivers web content to users' browsers over the internet when they request it, typically through the <strong>HTTP</strong> or <strong>HTTPS</strong> protocols.</p>

    <p>There are multiple ways content can be stored on a web server depending on the type of data and the server's configuration. Some of the ways are: <strong>File System</strong> (static files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and videos), <strong>Database</strong> for Dynamic Content and Data Models, <strong>Content Management System (CMS)</strong>, and <strong>Cloud Storage</strong>.</p>

    <p>Content in web pages is described using several key components and technologies: <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Images, and Multimedia</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Web Client</h2>
    <p>A web client is a software application or system that interacts with web servers to request and receive web content. The most common type of web client is a web browser.</p>

    <p>A web client performs several key functions that enable users to interact with web content. Some of the things they do are: <strong>Sends Requests, Receives Responses, Renders Content</strong>.</p>

    <p>Every web browser is a web client, but not every web client is a web browser. A web client is a broader term that refers to any software application or system that communicates with web servers to request and receive web content. This includes not only web browsers but also other applications that interact with web services. A web browser is a specific type of web client designed primarily for navigating the World Wide Web. It provides a user interface for accessing, rendering, and interacting with web content.</p>

    <h2>Hello World</h2>
    <p>The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element is a part of an HTML document that contains important information about the page, but it doesn’t display anything directly on the webpage (title, meta tags, links, scripts).</p>

    <p>The <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> declaration is a special instruction that tells the web browser which version of HTML the document is using. <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> specifies that the document is an HTML5 document, which is the latest version of HTML.</p>

    <p>The two topmost elements within the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element in an HTML document are: <strong>head</strong> and <strong>body</strong>. The head contains the information about the document but doesn’t display anything, whilst the body is the website itself.</p>

    <p>The <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag is used to define emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in <em>italic</em>.</p>

    <p>The <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tag is used to define text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in <strong>bold</strong>. You can also use <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> to make things bold but with no importance.</p>
